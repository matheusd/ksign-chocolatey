# Ksign Chocolatey Package

This is package for the community feed of [chocolatey](https://www.chocolatey.org).

This package encapsulates [KSoftware's ksign tool](http://codesigning.ksoftware.net/).

This was made to help automate the setup of developers machine's responsible for
signing executables and installers.

I am **not** affiliated in any capacity to KSoftware.

I **am** a happy customer of KSoftware certificates. If you need a code signing certificate,
you can't go wrong with them.
